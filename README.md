# HTW Suite
[experimental] A handy university management app

No more endlessly flipping all kinds of different websites for your uni stuff. Whether you want to check current week's schedule, view your grades, find lectures, read your mails or see what's for lunch today, now you got it all in one place, auto-login included.

This is an experimental project for private use. Up till now, your username and password have to be hardcoded into the MainActivity.kt, until I implement a way to safely and securely store these data on the device.
